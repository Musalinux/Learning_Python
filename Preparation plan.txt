ðŸš€ Final Tips to Crack J.P. Morgan
âœ” Explain Your Thought Process Clearly. If youâ€™re stuck on a coding question, talk through your logic.
âœ” Donâ€™t Memorize, Understand. Be ready to explain why you use a certain AWS service, not just what it does.
âœ” Behavioral Questions Matter. Have real examples for each leadership question.
âœ” Practice Talking! Even if alone, say your answers out loudâ€”it builds confidence.

This plan gives maximum focus on Python, AWS, DevOps, and System Design while balancing your Subway shifts and fasting schedule.

ðŸ”¥ You got this! Keep the momentum going, and youâ€™re going to do great. ðŸš€
